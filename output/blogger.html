<p>On-device AI improves privacy by keeping sensitive data local. Tasks such as voice recognition, real-time translation, image enhancement, and document summarization can be performed without sending personal data to the cloud.</p>
<h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
<p>Because data is processed locally, users gain better control over sensitive information. This reduces dependency on external servers.</p>
<h3>Performance Benefits</h3>
<p>Local processing reduces latency and allows AI features to respond instantly without internet delays.</p>
<h2>Hardware Enablers</h2>
